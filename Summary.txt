*** Summary

This folder contains the simualtion codes for the paper "Inverse Optimal Robust Adaptive Controller 
for Upper Limb Rehabilitation Exoskeletons with Inertia and Load Uncertainties" by Jiamin Wang,
and Oumar R. Barry (obarry@vt.edu), Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Tech.

In the paper, we proposed an inverse optimal robust adaptive controller designed for upper limb 
rehabilition exoskeleton tracking control under model uncertainties and disturbances. The control
simulation examples includes a stationary upper limb exoskeleton (Arm4D) and a wearable 
wrist exoskeleton (TAWE), both of which are presented in the paper. We demonstrate through 
simulations that the proposed controller can provide stable and reliable trajectory tracking for
rehabiliation exoskeletons. The proposed controller is also compared with other control algorithms,
combined with wrist kinematic algorithms, and implemented for termor supression.

The simulation codes containing abovementioned examples are submitted as supplemental files
for the review of the paper. The simulation details are commented in the scripts, as well as included 
in the supplemental document:
	"RA_L_20_1319_Supplemental_Document.pdf"
The instructions and summary of files are included in the ReadMe.txt. The codes will also be open
sourced at 
	https://github.com/VibRoLab-Group/IORAC_Exo
after the publication of the main paper. We will update the codes for possible future contents and
corrections.
