# Inverse Optimal Robust Adaptive Controller for Rehabilitation Exoskeletons
This is the link for the simulation codes of the inverse optimal robust adaptive controller for rehabiliation exoskeletons.

The work is presented in our paper "Inverse Optimal Robust Adaptive Controller for Rehabilitation Exoskeletons with Inertia and Load Uncertainties" by Jiamin Wang and Dr. Oumar Barry. We will release the codes after the paper is accepted/published. In the meantime, please contact Jiamin Wang (jmechw@vt.edu) if you would an early access to these codes.
